## 📜 Historical Context & Evidence

The **Game_of_Constants** explores the ancient intersection of linguistics and mathematics.

### Ancient Greece
The year 403 BC marks the **Archinidean Reform** in Athens, where the **Ionian System** (alphabetic numerals) replaced the older **Attic System**. 

* **Before 403 BC:** The Attic system used acrophonic tallies (e.g., **Δ** for 10, **H** for 100). Letters did not have sequential values.
* **After 403 BC:** The adoption of the 24-letter Ionian alphabet assigned every letter a fixed value ($\alpha=1, \beta=2$, etc.). This shift allowed the Greek language to finally parallel the mathematical logic of the Hebrew language.

### Semitic Precedent
While 403 BC was the turning point for the Greek world, the game leverages **Hebrew Gematria**, a system that predates the Greek reform. Because the Hebrew Aleph-Bet has always functioned as a numeral system, the logic of finding "constants of nature" in sacred and common text was likely being practiced long before the Greeks formalized their own version (Gemini AI, 2026).

The fact that these two distinct cultures converged on a shared mathematical-linguistic framework suggests the "Game of Constants" was already an established intellectual pursuit by the time the Ionian Reform took place.

## 🔬 How it Works
The game uses precalculated word summations using:
1. **Hebrew Gematria:** Traditional values from Aleph ($\aleph=1$) to Tav ($\tau=400$).
2. **Greek Isopsephy:** Post-403 BC standard values ($\alpha=1$ to $\omega=800$).
